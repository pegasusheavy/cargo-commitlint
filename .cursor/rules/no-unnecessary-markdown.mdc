# No Unnecessary Markdown Generation

## Rule
Do not generate unnecessary markdown files or markdown content unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Guidelines
- Do not create markdown documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- Do not generate markdown summaries of tasks or changes unless the user asks for them
- Do not create markdown comments or documentation blocks unless they serve a specific purpose
- Focus on code implementation rather than documentation unless documentation is the explicit goal
- When providing explanations or summaries, use plain text in responses rather than generating markdown files

## Exceptions
- README.md updates are acceptable when they are part of implementing a feature that requires documentation
- Code comments and doc comments in source files are always acceptable and encouraged
- Markdown in code (like Rust doc comments) is acceptable as it's part of the code itself
