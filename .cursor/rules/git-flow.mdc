# Git Flow Workflow

## Rule
This project uses git-flow branching model for version control and release management.

## Branch Structure
- **main/master**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **develop**: Integration branch for features, where development happens
- **feature/**: Feature branches branched from and merged back to develop
- **release/**: Release branches for preparing new releases, branched from develop
- **hotfix/**: Hotfix branches for urgent production fixes, branched from main/master
- **support/**: Support branches for older versions (if needed)

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always branch from `develop` when starting new features
- Feature branches should follow naming: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Release branches should follow naming: `release/x.y.z` (version number)
- Hotfix branches should follow naming: `hotfix/description-of-fix`
- Merge feature branches back to `develop` when complete
- Create release branches from `develop` when ready to release
- Merge release branches to both `main` and `develop` when complete
- Hotfixes branch from `main`, merge back to both `main` and `develop`

## Commit Messages
- Follow Conventional Commits specification (enforced by cargo-commitlint)
- Use appropriate types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, etc.
- Include scope when relevant: `feat(parser): add new feature`

## Best Practices
- Keep feature branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Regularly merge `develop` into feature branches to stay up to date
- Delete branches after merging
- Tag releases on `main` branch with version numbers
- Use pull requests/merge requests for code review before merging
