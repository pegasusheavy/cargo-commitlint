# Auto-Commit After Completion

## Rule
Always commit changes after completing a task or set of changes, unless explicitly told otherwise by the user.

## Guidelines
- After completing a task, create a git commit with an appropriate commit message
- Use Conventional Commits format for commit messages (enforced by cargo-commitlint)
- Commit message should describe what was done, not how it was done
- Use appropriate commit type: feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore, etc.
- Include scope when relevant to the change
- Commit should be atomic - group related changes together

## Commit Message Format
Follow Conventional Commits specification:
- `feat(scope): description` - for new features
- `fix(scope): description` - for bug fixes
- `docs(scope): description` - for documentation changes
- `refactor(scope): description` - for code refactoring
- `chore(scope): description` - for maintenance tasks
- `test(scope): description` - for test additions/changes

## When to Commit
- After implementing a feature or fix
- After making configuration changes
- After updating dependencies
- After refactoring code
- After adding or updating documentation
- After completing a set of related changes

## When NOT to Commit
- If the user explicitly asks not to commit
- If the changes are incomplete or broken
- If the user wants to review changes first
- If committing would break the build or tests

## Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change or related set of changes
- Ensure code compiles and tests pass before committing
- Use `git add` to stage specific files, not `git add .` unless all changes should be committed
