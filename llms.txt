# Configuration
Configuration file: commitlint.toml or .commitlint.toml
Format: TOML

Example configuration:
  [rules]
  [rules.type]
  enum = ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore"]
  case = "lowercase"

  [rules.scope]
  enum = []
  case = "lowercase"

  header_max_length = 72

# Conventional Commit Types

- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
