# ai.txt for cargo-commitlint

# Project Overview
cargo-commitlint is a Rust-based commit message linter that enforces the Conventional Commits specification. It provides a native Rust alternative to Node.js's commitlint, designed specifically for the Rust ecosystem.

# What is cargo-commitlint?
A command-line tool and git hook that validates commit messages to ensure they follow the Conventional Commits format. It helps maintain consistent, meaningful commit history across Rust projects.

# Key Capabilities
1. Validates commit messages against Conventional Commits specification
2. Configurable validation rules via TOML files
3. Automatic git hook installation
4. Integration with cargo-husky
5. Customizable rules for commit types, scopes, subjects, bodies, and footers
6. Regex-based parsing for flexible commit message formats
7. Ignore patterns for skipping validation on specific commits

# Installation Methods
- From source: Clone repository and run `cargo install --path .`
- From Crates.io: Run `cargo install cargo-commitlint`

# Common Use Cases
- Enforcing commit message standards in Rust projects
- Automating commit message validation via git hooks
- Maintaining consistent commit history for better changelog generation
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines for commit message checks

# Configuration
Configuration is done via TOML files (commitlint.toml or .commitlint.toml) in the project root. Supports:
- Type validation (allowed types, case requirements)
- Scope validation (allowed scopes, case requirements)
- Subject validation (case, length, formatting)
- Header validation (min/max length)
- Body and footer validation (formatting, line length)
- Custom parser patterns
- Ignore patterns

# Conventional Commits Format
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Supported types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

# Integration Points
- Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg)
- cargo-husky for hook management
- CI/CD pipelines
- Rust project workflows

# Documentation
Comprehensive documentation available at the project's documentation site, covering:
- Getting started guide
- Configuration options
- Examples and use cases
- API reference
- Contributing guidelines

# Technical Details
- Written in Rust
- Uses regex for commit message parsing
- TOML for configuration
- Command-line interface via cargo subcommand
- Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for validation failure
