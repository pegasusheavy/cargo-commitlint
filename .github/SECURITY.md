## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@pegasusheavyindustries.com](mailto:security@pegasusheavyindustries.com)**. You will receive a response within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Disclosure Policy

## Security Best Practices

When using cargo-commitlint:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your Rust toolchain and dependencies
2. **Review configuration**: Ensure your `commitlint.toml` doesn't expose sensitive information
3. **Use git hooks**: Enable git hooks to catch issues early
4. **Audit dependencies**: Run `cargo audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities
