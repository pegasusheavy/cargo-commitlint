   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards

3. **Write tests** for new functionality

4. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** following Conventional Commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```
